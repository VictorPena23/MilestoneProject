Survival/Obstical Game

This is my attempt to make a game similar to flappy bird because i feel its something that would help me better understand where I'm at with this course

I started this project in VS code desktop rather than the other way and starting it on the bowser

this game main objective is to avoid the obsticles and try to get a high score

You would only need to use the space bar to play this game

this game is 1 player (PvE)

this game starts with a UFO and you must avoid every obstacles and reach a high score

I was having issues with trying to add a photo without the background like the ufo

I used www.w3.org to look for font styles for my game

the images I found through google images. I tried to insert an png but for some reason I kept getting an error and nothing was showing up
